## Information

Calculates the electrical power required to cool a Helium coolant loop on the cold side of a heat exchanger. The power is calculated using the exergy change associated with bringing helium down to a given temperature tempC from room temperature. This is the method used by [1] (see p82). The logarithmic equation is a fit to values generated by coolprop.
