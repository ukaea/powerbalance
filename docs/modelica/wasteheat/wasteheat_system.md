# WasteHeat.WasteHeatSystem

## Information
Model of the power loads of the Waste Heat Management (formerly HVAC) system - takes in waste heat from other models and performs cooling with dehumidification calculation.

## Assumptions

- Cooling with Dehumidification process
- Steady flow process
- mass flow rate of air constant
- Air behaves and an ideal gas
- Kinetic energy and Potential energy negligible
- Heat transfer through floor is negligible
- If the waste power is below 5000 W dehumdifying is neglected due to small change in temperature.
