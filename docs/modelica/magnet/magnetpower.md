# Magnets.MagnetPower

The 'control' model that brings all coils together.

## Assumptions

- The resistance is assumed to be 100% dissipated in the Joints
- Eddy Currents are not considered
- Input is assumed dominant and mutual inductance are included as a nominal constant
- Saturation of the Inductor is not considered
- Temperature of the resistor and inductor are assumed to be constant
- Ground resistance and FDU resistance are not considered
- 6 PF coils assumed but this is a very tenuous assumption

S - Complex Power (is not actually AC complex power but a summation of real power dissipated and stored in the inductors)
